\section{Nonfunctional requirements}
\subsection{Usability}
The \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} should use the Windows design language such that it is intuitive for users who are used to the Windows platform.

Further more the UI must be minimalistic and the most frequently used features should be placed in views no further than two mouse clicks away from the startup page. Some training may be required to use the system since only employees will be using the system. \\

The \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} should follow modern website design thus making the site intuitive and easy to use for everyday users. Furthermore simplicity should be paramount, and viewing information about cars should be quick and not interrupting.

\subsection{Reliability}
For the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} and \texttt{DriveIT Web API} we use Azure to deploy the system. Due to this, we are not responsible for server maintenance and down time. \\
Azure is a reliable and fast deployment environment, saving us from the troubles of setting up and hosting our own deployment and server environment.

The three systems should have sufficient exception handling and therefore not crash unless something with the operating system or server fails.

\subsection{Performance}
The system should be responsive and fast to use. Most user actions should be done in the background, therefore giving the UI a fast feel. The startup time for the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} should be less than 5 seconds for a modern computer.

Furthermore the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} should be fast to use and all pages should be loaded in less than 2 seconds for a 10mbit/1mbit connection excluding browser rendering time, for a modern browser.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The systems should be easy to maintain and extend achieved through the use of good code structure and extensive documentation. If the system is to be updated a service window will be provided in time intervals with a low user amount.

\subsection{Portability}
It should be easy to port the functionality to other systems. This will be achieved by using a REST Web API therefore allowing other clients to access the same information. The \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} should be usable on mobile devices too.

\subsection{Implementation}
The system will be implemented in different ways. It will have a main \texttt{DriveIT Web API} that will be taking care of persistence and communication between the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} and the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client}. The system will mainly be implemented using the programming language C$\sharp$. Implementation in a popular language such as C$\sharp$ assures supportability and extendability. 
Using the .NET framework offers a lot of developer tools making life as a programmer easier and faster.

\subsection{Operations}
The system should mainly be maintained by the DriveIT developers, but training will be given to the employees using the system on a daily basis to make sure that day to day problems can be easily solved.
