\item John just recently bought a new car from DriveIT, a used car lot, which have anything from small cars to big and awesome looking cars.
\item For months, John's used car has been working as a dream, he felt that he couldn't get a better car for the same price.
\item He thought: "Wow, this car is the best used car ever, i better rate this car on the DriveIT homepage!"
\item John logs on into the homepage, happy about his recent purchase.
\item John searches for the car he just brought.
\item John rates 5/5, because he couldn't possibly get a better car than his recently bought used car.
