\begin{enumerate}
\item The car lot has just purchased a new used car.
\item Bob needs to put the newly purchased car up for sale, so that the customers of the car lot can see and hopefully buy it.
\item Bob knows the make and model of the car, but not any other information. He uses the system to find additional information about the car. 
\item Bob has also taken a photo of the car, and uploads this to the page of the car. 
\item Bob has put all the information and photos he knows into the system, and saves the information. 
\item Bob double-checks that the car is saved and put up for sale. He is happy to see that that is the case.
