\begin{enumerate}
 \item Jane, recently divorced, just had her tricycle stolen. With her regular commute of 36 miles each way, she spontaneously decides to purchase a car.
 \item Jane faintly recalls the midnight infomercial she viewed the previous night about the used car dealership.
 \item After removing the heap of dirty clothes from her chair and finding her laptop, she swiftly types in the URL of the web page of the used car dealership.
 \item Upon entering the website, she is prompted with a landing page, where she can see some of the most recently added cars. She can also go to a more advanced view where she can filter cars by her criteria.
 \item She spots the 'filter by fuel type' option and proceeds to locate the nearest blunt object to break her piggy bank.
 \item After counting her pennies, nickels, and dimes she sets the 'filter by fuel type' option to 'Diesel'.
 \item Jane continues to click the 'Search' button and sees a list of cars.
 \item Jane scrolls through the cars, looking at the specifications with her needs in mind, and ends up falling in love with the 2008 Mini Clubman Cooper.
