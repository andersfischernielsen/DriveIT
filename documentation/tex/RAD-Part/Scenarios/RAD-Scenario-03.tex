\begin{enumerate}
 \item Jane, recently divorced, just had her tricycle stolen. With her regular commute of 36 miles each way, she spontaneously decides to buy a car.
 \item Jane faintly recalls the midnight infomercial she viewed the previous night while enjoying a gallon of Ben \& Jerrys and binge-watching Bridget Jones.
 \item After removing the heap of dirty clothes from her chair and finding her laptop, she swiftly types in the URL for DriveIT's used car lot web page.
 \item Upon entering the website, she is prompted with a landing page, where she can see some of the most recently added cars. She can also go to a more advanced view where she can sort cars by a list of criteria.
 \item She quickly sports the `sort by fuel type' criteria, and proceeds to locate the nearest blunt object to break her piggy bank.
 \item After counting her pennies, nickels and dimes she sets the `sort by fuel type'-field to diesel.
 \item Jane continues to click the `search' button and receives the list of 3 cars.
 \item Jane scrolls through the cars, looking at the specifications with her needs in mind, and ends up falling in love with the 1899 Horsey Horseless.
