\section{Use Case Models}

\subsection{Scenarios}
Six specific scenarios have been chosen for detailed specification. These are the scenarios that are the most important to get a good understanding of the more complicated features of the system. A list of the scenarios not further specified can be seen in appendix \ref{sec:unspecified-use-case-models}

The scenarios that chosen to focus on are shown below. These scenarios were chosen since they represent some of the paramount parts of the system functionality, thus analysing these further will ensure that the main logic of the system is handled correctly.

\subsection{Use Case Model}
The use case model (fig. \ref{fig:UseCaseModel}) shows which actors can perform which use-cases.\\

The unregistered customer can browse cars, see a detailed view of a specific car, and browse employees.\\
A registered customer can do the same as the unregistered customer, but has access to modifying his or her user profile, as well as requesting to get contacted by an employee and the ability to comment on cars that are up for sale.
They also have the ability to see current contact requests that they have made and see all their previous orders.\\

An employee can browse cars, view details about cars, browse employees, modify, create, and view the list of customers who wants to be contacted regarding cars for sale, sell cars, and create, modify, and remove existing cars for sale on the web page.\\

The administrator is a special kind of employee who can access everything an employee can, as well as creating, modifying and removing other employees, and delete customer accounts.\\

\section{Use Cases}
Due to time constraints only five use cases are explained in detail. The selected use cases are the most critical for the user requirements and are important to support for the system to fulfil the users' requirements.
