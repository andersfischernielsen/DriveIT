\section{Use Case Models}

\subsection{Scenarios}
We have chosen to select six specific scenarios to specify detailed. These are the scenarios that we think are the most important ones to get a good understanding of the more complicated features of the system. A list of the scenarios not further specified can be seen in appendix %\ref{sec:unspecified_use_case_models}.

The scenarios that we have chosen to focus on are shown below. We have chosen these since, we think that they represent some of the paramount parts of the system functionality, thus analysing these further will ensure that the main logic of the system is handled correctly.

\subsection{Use Case Model}
The use case model shows which actors can use which use-cases.\\

The unregistered customer can browse cars, see a detailed view of a specific car and browse employees.\\
A registered customer can do the same as the unregistered customer, but has access to modifying his or her user profile, as well as requesting to get contacted by an employee and the ability to comment on cars that are up for sale.
They also have the ability to see current contact requests that they have made and see all their previous orders made.\\

An employee can browse cars, view cars, browse employees, modify, create and delete user accounts, view the list of customers who wants to be contacted regarding cars for sale, sell cars, and create, modify and remove existing cars for sale on the web page.\\

The administrator is a special kind of employee who can access everything an employee can, as well as creating, modifying and removing other employees.\\
