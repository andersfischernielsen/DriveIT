\section{Use Case Models}

\subsection{Scenarios}
We have chosen to select six specific scenarios to specify detailed. These are the scenarios that we think are the most important ones to get a good understanding of the more complicated features of the system. A list of the scenarios not further specified can be seen directly below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Contact interested customer
    \item Update car information
    \item Remove car from car lot database
    \item Search for cars that are up for sale
    \item Search for customers
    \item View orders
    \item Register a calling customer in the system
    \item Customer wants to delete account
    \item Customer wants to see cars with some specified specification
    \item A new employee is hired and must be added to the system
    \item An employee stops working at DriveIT and must be deleted from the system
    \item Information about an employee must be updated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Case Model}
The use case model shows which actors can use which use-cases.\\

The unregistered customer can browse cars, view cars (a more detailed view of a specific car) and browse employees.\\
The customer can do the same as the unregistered customer, but has access to modifying his or her own user account, as well as requesting a call from an employee and the ability to rate or comment a car for sale.\\

The employee can browse cars, view cars, browse employees, modify, create and delete user accounts, view the list of customers who wants to be contacted regarding cars for sale, sell cars, and create, modify and remove existing cars for sale on the web page.\\

The admin is a special kind of employee who can access everything an employee can, as well as creating, modifying and removing other employees.\\
