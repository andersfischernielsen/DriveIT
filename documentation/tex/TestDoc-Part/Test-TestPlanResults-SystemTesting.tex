\section{System Testing}
The \texttt{DriveIT System} has been under continuous testing throughout development.
As soon as the working prototype had been developed, the different components of the system were put together and system tested. 
By having a bottom-up approach the system tests were mainly focused on during the end of development after all lower sub systems had been unit- and integration tested.
