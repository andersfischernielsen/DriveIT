\section{System Testing}
The \texttt{DriveIT System} has been under continuous testing throughout development.

As soon as the working prototype had been developed, the different components of the system were put together and system tested. 
By having a bottom-up approach the system tests were mainly focused on during the end of development after all lower sub systems had been unit- and integration tested.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the unit testing of the system was primarily focused on the main scenarios and use cases. 

These should be supported, so that users are able to complete their tasks. Testing every single area of the system was not in scope, since this would take a very long time which was not available.

\subsection{Approach}
No systematic approach has been used for doing system tests. 

The \texttt{DriveIT Web} and \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} have been tested against the specified use cases in the Requirement Analysis Document to see whether every use case was possible to complete inside the functional and nonfunctional requirements.

When a use case was completed in an acceptable fashion the test was deemed as passed.

\subsection{Requirements}
The systems were tested so that it was possible to complete every use case while staying inside the functional and nonfunctional requirements.

\subsection{Results}
Both the \texttt{DriveIT Web} system and \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} have been tested in this loose manner. 

Both systems have completed the tests.
