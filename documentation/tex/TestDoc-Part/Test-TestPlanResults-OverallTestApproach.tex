\section{Overall Test Approach}
One of the non-functional requirements and design goals of the system was to have tested critical sections of the system.

This has been accomplished by using a bottom-up approach to testing. 
The deeper layers of the system providing data have been tested using unit testing, and other sub systems of the \texttt{DriveIT System} building on top of these systems have been integration and/or system tested. 

By trusting that the lower layers of the system function correctly these can then be used directly.
