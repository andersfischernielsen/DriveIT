\section{Overall Test Approach}
One of the non-functional requirements and design goals of the \texttt{DriveIT} system was to test critical sections of the system.

This has been accomplished by using a bottom-up testing approach. 
The deeper layers of the system providing data have been unit tested. Other subsystems of the \texttt{DriveIT System} building on top of these unit testes subsystems have been integration or system tested. 

Trusting that the lower layers of the system function correctly enables that these can be used directly for integration testing.
