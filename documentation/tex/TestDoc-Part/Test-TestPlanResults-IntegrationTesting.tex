\section{Integration Testing}
When implementing a system which is based on having a separation of application and storage, integration testing is of utmost importance. In this system we have both done both automatic and manual integration testing. The \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} has a full automatic integration testing of the CRUD functionalities for the entities \texttt{Car}, \texttt{ContactRequest}, \texttt{Employee}, \texttt{Customers} and \texttt{Sales}. Since the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} is able to chance between the local database and using the Azure Server, the testing can also be set up to test both of these environments. \\
The \textt{DriveIT Web Client} does not contain automatic integration testing but we have executed extensive testing based on the functionality which is provided to the Web Client by the Web API provides.
