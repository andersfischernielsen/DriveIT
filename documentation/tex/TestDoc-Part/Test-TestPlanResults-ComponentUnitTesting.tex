\subsection{Car Query Unit Testing}
The most significant methods have been unit tested in the \texttt{CarQuery} system.\\
Retrieving information as JSON and transfering this data to DTO objects has been tested to ensure that this functionality does not have any errors.\\
Checking that data is received and that this data is correct is tested by requesting a known data set (\texttt{"make=ford"}) and that the received data is of the correct type. Different queuries have also been tested against the API.\\ 
Boundary testing is performed by sending a malformed \texttt{CarDto} object as a parameter to the class and checking that a expected exception is thrown. Positive testing is performed as well by sending a correct \texttt{CarDto} object.
