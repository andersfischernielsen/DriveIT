\subsection{Car Query Unit Testing}
The most significant methods ensuring the functionality of the \texttt{CarQuery} class have primarily been unit tested.\\
Retrieving information as JSON and transfering this data to DTO objects has been tested to ensure that this functionality does not have any errors.\\
Checking that data is received and that this data is correct is tested by requesting a known data set (\texttt{"make=ford"}) and that the received data is of the correct type. Different queuries have also been tested against the API.\\ 
Boundary testing is performed by sending a malformed \texttt{CarDto} object as a parameter to the class and checking that a expected exception is thrown. Positive testing is performed as well by sending a correct \texttt{CarDto} object.

\subsection{Persistent Storage Unit Testing}
A subset of the functionality \texttt{PersistentStorage} subsystem has primarily been unit tested. This is due to the fact that much of the funtionality of the sub system is very similar.\\
As mentioned earlier the system supports create, read, update \& delete functionality of the entities of the \texttt{DriveIT System}. This functionality is very similar for the different data types, which is why testing has mainly been done for Car entities.\\
Focusing the testing on the underlying frameworks used in the classes does not make sense. Trusting that the developers of the Entity Framework have done extensive testing allows testing the logic in this class instead, which saves time and allows focusing on own logic.\\
Isolating the \texttt{PersistentStorage} logic requires setting up a mock of the DbContext and DbSet classes of Entity Framework to be able to test that the logic calls the right methods in these classes. The Moq NuGet package provides realtively easy mocking of these classes. \\
A list of Car objects is used as the input to a Mock object that is setup to provide the same functionality as the DbSet and DbContext classes. Tests can then be run on these classes.\\
The Moq framework provides methods to verify that a method has been run on the DbContext and thereby confirming that the method performed the correct action.
