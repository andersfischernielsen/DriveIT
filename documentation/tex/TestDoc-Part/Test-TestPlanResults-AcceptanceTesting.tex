\section{Acceptance Testing}
Since the project has no real product owner, acceptance test was done at each sprint by the team members. At the end of the last sprint (\todo{refDatSection} sprint 4) two acceptance tests were made, one for a potential employee of the company which uses the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} and the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client}, and another for a potential customer which would use the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client}.
