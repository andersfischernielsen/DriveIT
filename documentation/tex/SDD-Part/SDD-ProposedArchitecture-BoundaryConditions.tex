\section{Boundary Conditions}
\subsection{Service Boundary Condition}
For the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} and the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} to be initiated the \texttt{DriveIT Web API} must have been initialised otherwise all functionality will be unavailable. \\

Furthermore the \texttt{DriveIT Web API} must run constantly to allow the clients to persist and retrieve data.

\subsection{Subsystem Boundary Condition}
\subsubsection{DriveIT Web Client}
On initialisation of the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} all controllers are configured to map to certain routes. Furthermore \textit{OWIN}\footnote{\url{http://owin.org}} configured for the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client}. This is all done automatically by \textit{ASP.NET} and \textit{OWIN}. \\

Every time a page is loaded the data shown in the view is read from the \texttt{DriveIT Web API}, thereby synchronising data.\\

Exceptions which are not caught and handled, will display a generic status message, but will not crash the server.\\

No actions are currently performed at shutdown.

\subsubsection{DriveIT Windows Client}
On initialisation of the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} an \texttt{Employee} must sign in with a valid account in the \texttt{LoginView}. This initialises the static class \texttt{DriveITWebAPI} such that a connection to the \texttt{DriveIT Web API} can be established when needed.\\

To synchronise with the \texttt{DriveIT Web API}, the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} updates data each time a list-\texttt{View} changes.\\

The \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} handles exceptions by displaying an error message to the user in the \texttt{View} where the error originated. This is displayed in a status label, mentioning which action failed.\\

On shutdown the objects of the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} are disposed by the \textit{CLR}\footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4\%28v=vs.110\%29.aspx}}. No further actions are performed.
