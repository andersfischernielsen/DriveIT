\section{Global Software Control}

The flow of our system would be a Proceduce-driven control, and the reason for this, is that the program will follow specific prodecures, depending on how the \texttt{User}/\texttt{Employee} is interacting with the system.\\

Upon starting the system, the \texttt{User} will be presented with the main view of the system. It is not required to log into the system to use it. The \texttt{User} can freely navigate through the database searching for cars given the search criteria. Only when the \texttt{User} wishes to rate/be contacted about a car, a login wil be prompted.\\ 

This differs a bit for the \texttt{Employee} as their usage of the system is different. An \texttt{Employee} has tasks which require a higher access level, that are not available for a \texttt{User}. Therefore an \texttt{Employee} will log in upon starting up the system.\\

For loging in, the InputController of our Controller Subsystem will use the information entered into our login view to authenticate the information, and if the authentication is a success, or DataStorage Subsystem will access the information belonging to the \texttt{User}/\texttt{Employee}, and our Model Subsystem will then observe the DataStorage and update its state, whereafter the DriveITSystemView, from our View Subsystem, will be initialized and show the data received from the database.\\

The \texttt{User} can now interact with the sytem in multiple ways. For instance, the \texttt{User} can view the cars they are interested in. This task is handled by the InputController, which will register the activity of the \texttt{User}, update the state of the Model and then load it into the DriveITSystemView. In the background, new activity will be stored in the database, as the \texttt{User} is still using the system. If a change is commited, the Model will update its own state, whereafter the DriveITSystemView will be updated by the ViewController.\\

On the other hand an \texttt{Employee} will have the main task of handling requests for contact by a \texttt{User}. Anybody with \texttt{Employee} authentication, will have a shared `forum', where they can view a list of \texttt{Users} who are interested in cars/contact from an \texttt{Employee}. An \texttt{Employee} can now drag one of these requests into their own workfield and hereby claim a task. The same way as the task for a \texttt{User} above, the task will be  handled by the InputController, which will register the activity of the \texttt{Employee}, update the state of the Model and then load it into the DriveITSystemView. In the background, new activity will be stored in the database, as the \texttt{Employee} is still using the system. If a change is commited, the Model will update its own state, whereafter the DriveITSystemView will be updated by the ViewController.\\
