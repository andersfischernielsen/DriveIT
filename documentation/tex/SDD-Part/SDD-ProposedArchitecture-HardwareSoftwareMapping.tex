\section{Hardware and Software Mapping}
As the figure shows, we want to run our system on the following hardware:
The persistence, WebAPI and WebClient subsystems should be hosted on the same hardware which is a webserver running ASP.NET.\\
The WindowsApp runs on .NET 4(.5) and has a subsystem which helps communicating with CarQuery, which helps Employees fill out missing information about cars.

		% place the figure in the Figures folder (located with the main file)
		% you need to fix the scale a few times to get it right, but latex does not compress so one can always zoom in to see details.
