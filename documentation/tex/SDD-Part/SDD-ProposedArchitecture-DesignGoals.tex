\section{Design Goals}
\subsubsection{Powerful and easy usability}
The goal with the usability of the \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} is to give employees a powerful and easy to use tool to perform their work tasks. The gestalt laws are excellent examples on how to make a clean and simple user interface. By using the gestalt laws, we are able to make a clear distinction of which parts of the user interface that belongs to each other and thereby make it easier for the user to interact with the user interface. To give the employees a powerful tool, the most frequently used tasks must be achievable quickly but with possible extensions to allow more advanced options. Thus making the usability fast, but still advanced enough to be in appliance with the requirements.\\
%TODO more specific. In what way?

The goal with the usability of the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client}, is to have a website which is simple and provide the user with only a few actions. This will decrease the possibility of confusion and therefore hopefully keep the users on the site. Gestalt\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology} laws should be used in the making of the GUI such that it is easy for the user to see which functions maps together. 

\subsubsection{High Reliability} It is desired to create a reliable program that will prevent the user from losing progress made to the system due to unexpected events. By synchronizing with the Azure server after every CRUD action and not just at startup and shutdown, we ensure that a very minimal amount of data is lost, if a crash should occur. Should the system loose connection to the server an overlay message must be shown to the user such that it is not possible to continue work. This is a design choice which is chosen due to the time limit of the project. \\
Force restarting should not be acceptable and most exceptions must be caught and handled during runtime. By doing the above mentioned, data loss will be kept to a minimum by limiting it to the user's current activity, should a failure occur.

\subsubsection{Strong architecture with focus on extendability}
When rolling out future updates for the system, a full re-installation of the program will be necessary. This is due to resources allocated to other more desired design goals. It would be desirable to have a patch system, since this makes it less resource demanding to update the system in the future. It would also make it easier for the user to just accept and update instead of manually having to uninstall the applications and then reinstalling it again.\\

\subsubsection{Good documentation and Testing of the most important subsystems}
The system must be tested before release, but in a limited way, as a full system test cannot be accomplished due to the time frame set for the development of the system. We will therefore only focus on testing key components which are central and critical parts of our system.\\

Documentation will be a central part of our system, as it is important to keep documentation of how the system works as a whole, and how the modules or subsystem works separately, and by making this documentation, it will be easier to extend our system by developers that have no knowledge about the system.\\

\subsubsection{High portability}
To make sure that the system is easy to extend and scale, it will be build around a Web REST API that makes it easy to communicate with the system. This allows us to easily make applications for other platforms for example mobile devices that supports and use the \texttt{DriveIT WEB API}.\\

\subsubsection{Easy and efficient implementation}
The fact that the system will be developed and maintained in a popular and broadly used programming language such as C$\sharp$, assures a relatively painless implementations process. And since C$\sharp$ uses the @.NET platform there also are a lot of well designed and highly maintained tools available, minimizing the implementation time and increasing the quality of the software. \\

\subsubsection{Security}
It is not a part of the scope of this project to take security in to consideration. We have however taken security in to some kind of consideration, since we only want to allow some users access to some parts of the application. We will also be implementing a login system that hashes the password in the system. But security to an extent more advanced than this, will not be considered or implemented.
