\section{Overview}
This Software Design Document describes how the \texttt{DriveIT System} has been built.
This document describes the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Subsystem Decomposition
	\item Hardware and Software Mapping
	\item Persistent Data Management
	\item Access Control
	\item Global Software Control
	\item Boundary Conditions \&
	\item Persistent Data Management
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{DriveIT System} is primarily composed of five systems: 
A web client for customers to browse cars, a Windows client for employees to use, a Web API serving the clients data, a \texttt{CarQuery} system for fetching extra data about cars and a database system for storing and fetching data in a persistent storage system.
