\section{Overview}
This Software Design Document describes how the \texttt{DriveIT System} has been built.
This document describes the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Subsystem Decomposition
	\item Hardware and Software Mapping
	\item Persistent Data Management
	\item Access Control
	\item Global Software Control
	\item Boundary Conditions \&
	\item Persistent Data Management
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{DriveIT System} is primarily composed of five subsystems: 
A web client for customers, a Windows client for employees. Furthermore a REST\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST}} web API functioning as a connection between the clients and the data-storage, a \texttt{CarQuery} subsystem for fetching extra data about cars, and a subsystem for storing and fetching data in a Microsoft SQL Database.
