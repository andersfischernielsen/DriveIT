Due to the fact that the DriveIT System is available for many users, it is necessary to keep track of which users may have access to specific resources in our system. To keep track of which users got access to which resources, it is necessary to check each user at login, through authentication, to confirm which resources they can access.\\

In our system, a non-registered user (a person accessing the DriveIT homepage without logging in) should be restricted to only be able to search for \texttt{Car}s, get a list of \texttt{Employee}s and create a new user on the homepage.\\

The \texttt{Customer} is able to access more on the DriveIT homepage than a non-registered user. The \texttt{Customer} is able to access the same information as a non-registered user, but are also able to look through his or her own \texttt{Order}s, and also able to create, update or delete his or her own \texttt{Comment}s on cars.\\

The \texttt{Employee} is able to create, update, delete and search for \texttt{Car}s. The \texttt{Employee} is also able to create a new user (if a person calls the company using the \texttt{DriveIT System} for help), get information about a specific \texttt{Customer} and update a \texttt{Customer} by request. The \texttt{Employee} is also able to create a \texttt{Sale}, see the \texttt{Sale}s of a specific \texttt{Customer}, update and delete a \texttt{Sale}. The \texttt{Employee} should also be able to get a list of other \texttt{Employee}s, if it is needed in any case.\\

An administrator is a special kind of \texttt{Employee}, who can do everything the \texttt{Employee} can, but also create, update and delete other \texttt{Employee}s and administrators.

There is a bug in the DriveIT Web Client which means that \texttt{Employee}s and administrators can create \texttt{Comment}s and \texttt{ContactRequest}s. They cannot manage other peoples \texttt{Comment}s and \texttt{ContactRequest}s though. Also, details about orders and comments does not work as supposed for customers, when accessed by \texttt{Employee}s. Information about \texttt{Employee}s and administrators cannot be changed through the Web Client, as it was not meant to support this feature.
