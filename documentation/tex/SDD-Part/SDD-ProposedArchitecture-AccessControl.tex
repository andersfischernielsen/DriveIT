Due to the fact that our DriveIT System is available for many users, it is neccessary to keep track of which users may have access to specific ressources in our system. To keep track of which users got access to which ressources, it is neccessary to check each user at login, through authentication, to confirm which ressources they can access.\\

In our system, a non-registered user (a person accessing the DriveIT homepage without login) should be restricted to only be able to search for cars, get a list of employees and create a new user on the homepage.\\

The customer is able to access more on the DriveIT homepage than a non-registered user. The customer is able to access the same information as a non-registered user, but are also able to look through his or her own orders, and also able to create, update or delete his pr her own comments on cars.\\

The employee is able to create, update or delete cars, and search for cars. The employee is also able to create a new user (if a person calls the \todo{company}company for help), get information about a specific user and update a user by request of a customer. The employee is also able to create an order, see the orders of a specific customer, update an order and delete an order. The employee should also be able to get a list of employees, if it is needed in any case.\\

Administrators of the system can do everything the employee can, but also create, update and delete other employees and administrators.
