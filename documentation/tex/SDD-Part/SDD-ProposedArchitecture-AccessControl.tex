	\caption{Access Matrix for the \texttt{DriveIT System}}
	\label{fig:accessMatrix}
\end{figure}

Due to the fact that the \texttt{DriveIT System} is available for many users, it is necessary to keep track of which users may have access to specific resources in the system. To keep track of which users have access to which resources, it is necessary to check each user at login, through authentication, to confirm which resources they can access. Figure \ref{fig:accessMatrix} shows which functionality the different actor types have access to.\\

In the \texttt{DriveIT System} a non-registered customer is restricted to browse \texttt{Car}s with comments, get a list of \texttt{Employee}s and create an account on the homepage.\\

The \texttt{Customer} is able to access the same information as a non-registered customer, but is also able to look through in \texttt{Sale}s which he or she has been part of, and able to create, update or delete his or her own \texttt{Comment}s on \texttt{Car}s.\\

The \texttt{Employee} is able to create, read, update, and delete \texttt{Car}s. The \texttt{Employee} is also able to create a new \texttt{Customer}, get information about a specific \texttt{Customer} and update a \texttt{Customer} by request. The \texttt{Employee} can furthermore create a \texttt{Sale}, read all \texttt{Sale}, update, and delete a \texttt{Sale}. The \texttt{Employee} can read a list of other \texttt{Employee}s.\\

An administrator is a special kind of \texttt{Employee}, who can do everything the \texttt{Employee} can, but in addition create, update and delete other \texttt{Employee}s and administrators. \texttt{Customer} accounts can be deleted by the administrator role.\\

The \texttt{DriveIT Web API} supports that \texttt{Employee}s and administrators can read \texttt{Comment}s on \texttt{Car}s. It furthermore supports that administrators can delete comments. The \texttt{DriveIT Windows Client} does not support these features.\\

There is a bug in the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client} which means that \texttt{Employee}s and administrators can create \texttt{Comment}s and \texttt{ContactRequest}s. They cannot manage other \texttt{Customer}'s \texttt{Comment}s and \texttt{ContactRequest}s though. Information about \texttt{Employee}s and administrators cannot be changed through the \texttt{DriveIT Web Client}, as it was not meant to support this functionality.
