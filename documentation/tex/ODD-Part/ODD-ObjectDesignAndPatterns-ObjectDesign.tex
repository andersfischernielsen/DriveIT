\subsection{Encapsulation}
Encapsulation has been a high priority during development of the \texttt{DriveIT System}. 

Keeping functionality of different sub systems encapsulated has helped debugging and refactoring. Extensibility is also made easier in the future.

\subsubsection{PersistentStorage}
Encapsulation has been used in the \texttt{Persistent Storage} system in methods dealing with retreiving, editing and deleting entities. Methods generally have few side effects and only do not keep references to others classes after performing their task.

A design choice in implementing the methods were to only keep a \texttt{DriveITContext} (which inherits from \texttt{DbContext}) in memory for a short amount of time to ensure that the context only fulfilled its purpose in dealing with the entities and then was discarded.

Updating entities requires copying all attributes of the entity which is done in separate methods without side effects.
