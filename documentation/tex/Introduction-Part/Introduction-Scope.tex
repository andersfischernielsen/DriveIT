\section{Scope of the System}
The scope of the system is to deliver a functional piece of software which allows employees at a used car dealership to fulfil their daily tasks managing cars, customers, sales, and other employees.\\\\
The system must support creating, reading, updating, and deleting data types of the car dealership provided the user of the given sub system has the right authorisation.
These include used cars, customers, employees, sales, comments on cars, and requests for contact from an interested customer. 
Cars can have several pictures attached to them which should be available to users of the system. 
The data of the system should be stored persistently in a hosted database.
