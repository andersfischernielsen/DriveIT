\section{Purpose of the system}
The DriveIT system should provide a fictional used car lot with a way to manage sales of used cars. 

The used car lot has a number of employees that need to register cars, sales and customers. Potential customers interested in cars should be able to view and notify the company of their interest in a car. 

This functionality should be implemented using a Windows application and a web client. The system should also support persistent saving of the data in the system.
