\section{Non-Scope of the System}
It is not in the scope of this system to provide a fully testable, error-free application. Developing a system without any errors is therefore outside the scope of this project. 

Nor is it the scope to have all business logic complete. The system should be have room for expansion and therefore should not be seen as a completely finished product but more as a nearly finished release. 

Some functionality will be shown, but might not be functional. This functionality will then be achievable to implement in a future release.

The system will not support users other than the ones specified in this document - the employees and customers at the used car lot. The system is not supposed to be designed for general customer and sales management.
