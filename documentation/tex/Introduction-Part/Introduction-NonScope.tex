\section{Non-Scope of the System}
It is not in the scope of this system to provide a fully testable, non-error application, nor is it the scope to have all business logic complete. The system should be expandable and therefore should not be seen as a completely finished product but more as a 0.9 release. Settings and help menus are not going to be available but should be achievable to implement in the near future.
