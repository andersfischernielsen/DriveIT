\section{Non-Scope of the System}
It is not in the scope of this system to provide a fully tested, error-free application. Developing a system without any errors is therefore outside the scope of this project. 

Nor is it in the scope to have all business logic complete. The system should have room for expansion and  should therefore not be seen as a completely finished product, but more as a nearly finished release. 

Some functionality will be shown, but might not be functional. This functionality will then be achievable to implement in a future release. This also means that any handling of receipts and transactions is not supported.

The system should not support remote patching by the developers. If an update for the system is released, it should not be required that users are able to download and install this patch in the system automatically, and a reinstall might be required.

The system will not support users other than the ones specified in this document - the employees and customers at the used car lot. The system is not supposed to be designed for general customer and sales management.
