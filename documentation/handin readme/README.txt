DRIVEIT SYSTEM

==============



This is the README for the finished DriveIT System. 
This document will describe how 
to run the system and what is included.




WEB CLIENT

==============

The DriveIT Web Client is available on the website http://driveit.azurewebsites.net.

Opening the URL in a modern browser will launch the client.





WINDOWS CLIENT

==============

Included in this .zip file is the compiled binary for the DriveIT Windows Client. 

Running “DriveIT.WindowsClient.exe” will launch the client. 



COMPILING YOURSELF

==============

If you wish to compile the either client yourself, the complete source code for the 
entire DriveIT system has been attached as well. 
Double clicking on “DriveIT.sln” will open the solution in Visual Studio, where the 
DriveIT Windows Client and DriveIT Web can be set as the Startup Project and 
compiled.



Compiling the DriveIT Windows Client in Debug Mode will make the DriveIT Windows 
Client run on a database hosted locally. 

The login for the DriveIT Windows Client is: awis@itu.dk with the password: 4dmin_Password

Compiling the DriveIT Windows Client in Release Mode will make the DriveIT Windows 
Client run on the production database hosted on Microsoft Azure (the same on that 
the .exe is running on).



Running the DriveIT Web Client using Visual Studio will make the web client run 
locally.
