%Template for adding a figure to the documentation
% For a picture with a widt of 1080 a scale of 0.35 fits perfect
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Figures/FileName}\\
		% place the figure in the Figures folder (located with the main file)
		% you need to fix the scale a few times to get it right, but latex does not compress so one can always zoom in to see details.
	\caption{Describe the picture}
  \label{fig:LabelName}
  % label it something meanfull
\end{figure}
% If you want to reference the label in your text use this:
Figure~\ref{fig:LabelName}
