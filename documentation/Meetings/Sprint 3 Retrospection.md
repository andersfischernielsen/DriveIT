Sprint 2: Retrospection
=====
_Facilitated by Jacob Stenum Czepluch (SCRUM master)_

What Could Be Improved?
-----
- We need to stay on top of updating the SCRUM tool (VS Online).
- We need a better delegation of work. Some group members relaxed a bit. 
	- Better time estimates could fix this.
- The placement of big tasks (that affect other parts of the product) should be changed so that these happen at the beginning of the sprint. That should free up other team members so that they are less stressed by the end of a sprint. 
- We need to get better at attending the stand up meetings.  
- Noone should be working at the SCRUM meetings. **NO CODING!**
 
What Went Well?
-----
- The group is somewhat following the time frame for the product. We're not **too** far behind so far.
- Time estimates are generally okay, everything considered. 
- The communication of the group is fine. The Facebook group is working beautifully. 

Presentation of Work
-----
We have no product owner, so the group therefore pretended to be the group owner while also being the developer of the product.

Some group members have presented their finished work and eveything that people finished in time looks good.
Some tasks were not completed, and did not work, when we tried to show them off. 
Minor improvements have either been planned and added to the next sprint, with mostly the same people assigned.
The work group members didn't have time to finish have been added to the next sprint.
