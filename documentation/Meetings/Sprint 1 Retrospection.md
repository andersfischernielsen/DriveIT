Sprint 1: Retrospection
=====
_Facilitated by Jacob Stenum Czepluch (SCRUM master)_

What Could Be Improved?
-----
- Mikael would like to be able to see stuff in VS Online. He had no access.
- LaTeX is horrible, no one likes using it.
- TeX templates are weird and we spent time figuring them out.
- Markdown would make (at least Fischer's) life easier. 
- LaTeX conventions need to be specified and **used**. This takes time.
- Wind does not want to be the "tex-guy". Everyone needs to LaTeX their own stuff.


What Went Well?
-----
- Work went well. 
- People managed their time well.
- The workload will increase when coding starts.
- Facebook group worked really well.
- Tasks and SCRUM interface online works well.
- Graphical online interface gives a nice overview.
- Git works, branching is going to be interesting. 

Presentation of Work
-----
We have no product owner, so the group therefore pretended to be the group owner while also being the developer of the product.

All group members have checked the work together, and everything looks the way it should. 
Minor improvements have either been made or planned and added to the next sprint.
