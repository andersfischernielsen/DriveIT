Sprint 2: Retrospection
=====
_Facilitated by Anders Wind Steffensen (SCRUM master)_

What Could Be Improved?
-----
- Everyone would like a bit more time, but still felt they finished the most important work.
- Git branching is okay, some people still don't quite get it, but we have not had any major conflicts.
- We forgot the documentation a bit this time, focusing more on code. 
- Some group members underestimated the time they thought they would spend to finish a task.
- We need to remember to update the SCRUM online tool so that the burndown chart is correct.
- Visual Studio can be a bitch. There's too much black magic.

What Went Well?
-----
- Work went well. We managed to accomplish the major goals (working prototype).
- People managed their time okay. 
- Facebook group still works well.
- Git is awesome when it works.

Presentation of Work
-----
We have no product owner, so the group therefore pretended to be the group owner while also being the developer of the product.

All group members have presented their finished work and eveything that people finished in time looks good.
Minor improvements have either been planned and added to the next sprint, with mostly the same people assigned.
Work people didn't have time to finish have been added to the next sprint.
