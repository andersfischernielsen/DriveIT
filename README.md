The repository for our third semester exam project at the IT University of Copenhagen.

###The group has agreed to use the following tools:
- SCRUM - Sprints will start Wednesday and end on Tuesday.
    - SCRUM meetings take place every morning at 10.
    - Sprints will be reflected on Tuesdays.
- Visual Studio Online - For SCRUM management.
- Microsoft Azure - for cloud hosting.

###Goals
- Fulfill the minimum software specifications, but fulfill them well.
- By well, the group prioritizes good software architecture following common design patterns and well-structured code. 
- The documentation should follow the code. 
- By this the group means that the documentation (RAD, SDD) should be written alongside the code. 
- Code should never be different than what is in the documentation. 

###Team procedures
- When a given team members task is done, he will mark it as "Done". Then it is up to another group member to mark this as "Accepted" if it truly is acceptable. No task is "Done" until it passes every test. 
- Is is hereafter okay for other team members to refine the task, if this improves the code and doesn't break things.
- Testing is used extensively in the code, but Test Driven Development will not be used. Team members will test when they feel like it. 
- Use version tracking often. Git commits should happen often and on a single file basis, unless the files truly belong to the same task.
- The team will branch every task out in a seperate branch, and **only** merge it into the master branch when it is finished. 
- The team members must never commit an unfinished feature or a program that will not compile. 
- After every sprint a document will be formed, where the lessons the team have learned after the given sprint are written down.
